A numbering scheme for bugs in Snowball was started in Feb 2003, when the
released code had become stable enough for bug fixing to be a rare event.

The bugs so far found are as follows. (The dates - British format - refer
to when the bugs were fixed.)

#1   23/2/2003
     Noticed by: Martin
     Symptom: '$ s ( C )' causing a compiler crash when s undeclared.
     Modules affected: analyser.c
     Notes: 's undeclared' was reported before the crash, so it looked
         like a valid termination, albeit with truncated error messages.
