announcements will also be posted to this list.

<a href="http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.search.snowball">Archives</A>

</p><p>

<a href="http://lists.tartarus.org/mailman/listinfo/snowball-commits">Snowball-commits</a>
is a readonly list.  Whenever a change is made to Snowball, a message will
automatically be sent to this list: it is therefore fairly high volume, and
only of interest to people actively working on Snowball.
