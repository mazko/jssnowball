You can use this site at a number of levels:

<BR><BR>

- You can look at the stemming algorithm definitions themselves, and use
them as templates for coding your own versions of stemmers in the computer
language of your choice.

<BR><BR>

- You can use the various ANSI C
and Java stemmers in programs of your own,
without bothering yourself
with the Snowball system that generated them. To do that,
download either the

<A HREF="../dist/libstemmer_c.tgz">C</A>
or the
<A HREF="../dist/libstemmer_java.tgz">Java</A>

version of the libstemmer library, and follow the instructions
contained in the &nbsp;<TT>README</TT>&nbsp; files within these tarballs.
The tarballs also contain simple example
programs which allow you to run the stemmers from the command line.
<BR><BR>

- You can get involved in Snowball itself. This is particularly worthwhile
if you want to adjust the stemmers or develop new stemmers. A typical reason
for adjusting the stemmers is that you are working with a different encoding
of accented letters from the ISO Latin I encoding assumed in most of the scripts
here. Then you need to make your own version of the Snowball compiler and
work with the Snowball scripts.

<DL><DD>

Snowball is a language in which stemming algorithms can be easily
represented. The Snowball compiler translates a Snowball script (a &nbsp;<TT>.sbl</TT>
file) into either a thread-safe ANSI C program or a Java program.
For ANSI C, each Snowball script produces a program file and
corresponding header file
(with &nbsp;<TT>.c</TT>&nbsp; and &nbsp;<TT>.h</TT>&nbsp; extensions). The language has a full

    <A HREF="../compiler/snowman.html"> manual</A>,

and the various stemming scripts act as example programs.

- You can get deeply interested in stemming. If you do, read the

    <A HREF="../texts/introduction.html"> introductory paper</A>

about Snowball. It is a bit heavyweight, but provides essential background.
And look at the

    <A HREF="../texts/howtohelp.html"> notes</A>

on how you can help.
