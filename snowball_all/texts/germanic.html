Despite its inflexional complexities, German has quite a simple suffix
structure, so that, if one ignores the almost intractable problems of
compound words, separable verb prefixes, and prefixed and infixed <B><I>ge</I></B>, an
algorithmic stemmer can be made quite short. (Infixed <B><I>zu</I></B> can be removed
algorithmically, but this minor feature is not shown here.) The umlaut in
German is a regular feature of plural formation, so its removal is a
natural feature of stemming, but this leads to certain false conflations
(for example, <I>sch&ouml;n</I>, beautiful; <I>schon</I>, already).
<BR><BR>
By contrast, Dutch is inflexionally simple, but even so, this does not make
for any great difference between the stemmers. A feature of Dutch that
makes it markedly different from German is that the grammar of the written
language has changed, and continues to change, relatively rapidly, and that
it has assimilated a large and mixed foreign vocabulary with some of the
accompanying foreign suffixes. Foreign words may, or may not, be
transliterated into a Dutch style. Naturally these create problems in
stemming. The stemmer here is intended for native words of contemporary
Dutch.
<BR><BR>
In a Dutch noun, a vowel may double in the singular form (manen = moons, maan
= moon). We attempt to solve this by undoubling the double vowel (Kraaij
Pohlman by contrast attempt to double the single vowel). The endings <B><I>je</I></B>,
<B><I>tje</I></B>, <B><I>pje</I></B> etc., although extremely common, are not stemmed. They are
diminutives and can significantly alter word meaning.

<BR>&nbsp;<H2>A note on compound words</H2>

Famously, German allows for the formation of long compound words, written
without spaces. For retrieval purposes, it is useful to be able to search
on the parts of such words, as well as the on the complete words
themselves. This is not just peculiar to German: Dutch, Danish, Norwegian,
Swedish, Icelandic and Finnish have the same property. To split up
compound words cannot be done without a dictionary, and the purely
algorithmic stemmers presented here do not attempt it.

<BR><BR>

We would suggest, however, that the need for compound word splitting in
these languages has been somewhat overstated. In the case of German:

<BR><BR>

1) There are many English compounds one would see no advantage in
splitting,

<DL><DD><TABLE CELLPADDING=0>
<TR><TD>    blackberry  <TD></TD><TD>  blackboard  <TD></TD><TD>  rainbow  <TD></TD><TD>  coastguard <TD></TD><TD> ....
</TABLE></DL>

Many German compounds are like this,

<DL><DD><TABLE CELLPADDING=0>
<TR><TD>    Bleistift (pencil)      <TD></TD><TD> = <TD></TD><TD> Blei (lead) + Stift (stick)
<TR><TD>    Eisenbahn (railway)     <TD></TD><TD> = <TD></TD><TD> Eisen (iron) + Bahn (road)
<TR><TD>    Unterseeboot (submarine)<TD></TD><TD> = <TD></TD><TD> under + sea + boat
</TABLE></DL>

2) Other compounds correspond to what in English one would want to do by
phrase searching, so they are ready made for that purpose,

<DL><DD><TABLE CELLPADDING=0>
<TR><TD>    Gesundheitspflege      <TD></TD><TD>  = <TD></TD><TD> &#8216;health care&#8217;
<TR><TD>    Fachhochschule         <TD></TD><TD>  = <TD></TD><TD> &#8216;technical college&#8217;
<TR><TD>    Kunstmuseum            <TD></TD><TD>  = <TD></TD><TD> &#8216;museum of fine art&#8217;
</TABLE></DL>

3) In any case, longer compounds, especially involving personal names, are
frequently hyphenated,

<DL><DD>    Heinrich-Heine-Universit&auml;t
</DL>

4) It is possible to construct participial adjectives of almost any
length, but they are little used in contemporary German, and regarded now
as poor style. As in English, very long words are not always to be taken
too seriously. On the author's last visit to Germany, the longest word he
had to struggle with was

<DL><DD>    Nasenspitzenwurzelentz&uuml;ndung
</DL>

It means &#8216;inflammation of the root of the tip of the nose&#8217;, and comes from
a cautionary tale for children.
