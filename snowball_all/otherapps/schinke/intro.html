<P>
The Schinke Latin stemming algorithm is described in,
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    Schinke R, Greengrass M, Robertson AM and Willett P (1996) A stemming algorithm for Latin text
    databases. <I>Journal of Documentation</I>, <B>52</B>: 172-187.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

It has the feature that it stems each word to two forms, noun and verb. For example,
<PRE>
                NOUN        VERB
                ----        ----
    aquila      aquil       aquila
    portat      portat      porta
    portis      port        por
</PRE>

Here (slightly reformatted) are the rules of the stemmer,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
1. (start)

2.  Convert all occurrences of the letters 'j' or 'v' to 'i' or 'u',
    respectively.

3.  If the word ends in '-que' then
        if the word is on the list shown in Figure 4, then
            write the original word to both the noun-based and verb-based
            stem dictionaries and go to 8.
        else remove '-que'

    [Figure 4 was

        atque quoque neque itaque absque apsque abusque adaeque adusque denique
        deque susque oblique peraeque plenisque quandoque quisque quaeque
        cuiusque cuique quemque quamque quaque quique quorumque quarumque
        quibusque quosque quasque quotusquisque quousque ubique undique usque
        uterque utique utroque utribique torque coque concoque contorque
        detorque decoque excoque extorque obtorque optorque retorque recoque
        attorque incoque intorque praetorque]

4.  Match the end of the word against the suffix list show in Figure 6(a),
    removing the longest matching suffix, (if any).

    [Figure 6(a) was

        -ibus -ius  -ae   -am   -as   -em   -es   -ia
        -is   -nt   -os   -ud   -um   -us   -a    -e
        -i    -o    -u]

5.  If the resulting stem contains at least two characters then write this stem
    to the noun-based stem dictionary.

6.  Match the end of the word against the suffix list show in Figure 6(b),
    identifying the longest matching suffix, (if any).

    [Figure 6(b) was

    -iuntur-beris -erunt -untur -iunt  -mini  -ntur  -stis
    -bor   -ero   -mur   -mus   -ris   -sti   -tis   -tur
    -unt   -bo    -ns    -nt    -ri    -m     -r     -s
    -t]

    If any of the following suffixes are found then convert them as shown:

        '-iuntur', '-erunt', '-untur', '-iunt', and '-unt', to '-i';
        '-beris', '-bor', and '-bo' to '-bi';
        '-ero' to '-eri'

    else remove the suffix in the normal way.

7.  If the resulting stem contains at least two characters then write this stem
    to the verb-based stem dictionary.

8.  (end)

Unfortunately I was not able to make the rules match the examples given, which
led to the following email correspondence,

 Peter,

 Well, actually, I do have a question, if you can cast your mind back. I've
 implemented the Latin Stemmer in Snowball (see below: you'll have to guess the
 semantics, but I'm sure you'll agree the syntax looks nice), and find that Fig
 5 of the 1996 Schinke paper doesn't correpond to the algorithm of fig 7, but to
 the algorithm with the extra rules concerning -ba-, -bi-, -sse- mentioned on
 page 182. Which is the "correct" algorithm - with or without those rules? If
 with, what is the exact criterion for their removal? A bigger problem is why
 the -nt is not removed from 'Apparebunt', given -nt as an ending in 6(a). Is
 -nt a misprint?

 Sorry to bother you with this, but the paper says you are the one "to whom all
 correpondence should be addressed" :-)

 Martin



 Here is your algorithm in Snowball. The generated code will do about 1 million
 Latin word in 5 seconds:

 -------


 strings ( noun_form  verb_form )

 routines (

    map_letters
    que_word
 )

 externals ( stem )

 define map_letters as (

     do repeat ( goto ( ['j'] ) <- 'i' )
     do repeat ( goto ( ['v'] ) <- 'u' )
 )

 backwardmode (

     define que_word as (

         ['que'] (
             among (
                 'at' 'quo' 'ne' 'ita' 'abs' 'aps' 'abus' 'adae' 'adus'
                 'deni' 'de' 'sus' 'obli' 'perae' 'plenis' 'quando' 'quis'
                 'quae' 'cuius' 'cui' 'quem' 'quam' 'qua' 'qui'
                 'quorum' 'quarum' 'quibus' 'quos' 'quas' 'quotusquis'
                 'quous' 'ubi' 'undi' 'us' 'uter' 'uti' 'utro' 'utribi'
                 'tor' 'co' 'conco' 'contor' 'detor' 'deco' 'exco' 'extor'
                 'obtor' 'optor' 'retor' 'reco' 'attor' 'inco' 'intor'
                 'praetor'
             ) atlimit ]
             => noun_form
             => verb_form
         ) or fail(delete)
     )
 )

 define stem as (

     map_letters

     backwards (
         que_word or (
             => noun_form
             => verb_form

             $noun_form backwards try (
                 [substring] hop 2
                 among (

                         (delete)
                 )
             )

             $verb_form backwards try (
                 [substring] hop 2
                 among (
                     'iuntur' 'erunt' 'untur' 'iunt' 'unt'
                          (<-'i')

                 )
             )
         )
     )

     /* the stemmed words are left in noun-form and verb-form, and can
        be picked up as C strings at z->S[0] and z->S[1] through the API. */

 Sorry - I just cannot answer.  Robertson has retired to Dorset while
 Schinke is now in - I think - Canada

Following this, I was unable to contact Schinke, and so the problems have
remained unresolved.
<P>

The linked <A HREF="schinke.tgz">zip file</A> contains the stemmer,
generated C version, and sample data.
(The stemmer differes slightly from the version in the email above in that
it assembles the noun- and verb-forms of the stem in a single string with
space separation.)
<TT>voc.txt</TT> is a sample vocabulary, and <TT>joined.txt</TT> the vocabulary
joined with the two stemmed forms as three column output.
